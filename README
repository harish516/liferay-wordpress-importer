Liferay Wordpress Importer Portlet

There are more and more companies migrating their contents from Wordpress sites to Liferay.

The goal of this project is to provide the tools needed for the users to successfully import all their Wordpress contents into Liferay.

This project is licensed as LGPL so feel free to modify it, improve it and contribute new features and bug fixes.
